# FileMover
This is a simple java program that is ran from the command line and is used to monitor a folder for new files. When files are present, FileMover will move your files to a specified location. Movements can be set up by keys in the file name, file type, regex patterns, and others. Files will be automatically rename, moved, copied, or any combination of those to another location.
